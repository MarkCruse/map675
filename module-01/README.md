#MAP 675

##Module-01  The code below showcases how to improve the visual experience with a map.
This leaflet map shows the importance of visual hierarchy, the order in which features are drawn to the map.
Subtle variations of fill and stroke color and opacity establish the ground (in this case the urban extent,
city boundaries, and neighborhoods). More strongly contrasting stroke color(s) are used for the transportation routes,
which rise to figure on the map and are likely the first point of engagement with a user.
