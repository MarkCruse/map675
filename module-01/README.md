The lesson introduces the use of command-line processes to ease data processing and map development. Concepts introduced
effectively use the command-line interface (terminal & Git) along with other useful GeoSpatial utility libraries such as GDAL/OGR
and Mapshaper for manipulating data files.
 
The leaflet map (index.html) shows the importance of visual hierarchy, the order in which features are drawn to the map.
Subtle variations of fill and stroke color and opacity establish the ground (in this case the urban extent,
city boundaries, and neighborhoods). More strongly contrasting stroke color(s) are used for the transportation routes,
which rise to figure on the map and are likely the first point of engagement with a user.
