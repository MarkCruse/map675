#MAP 675

##Module-01
The leaflet map included in this module shows the importance of visual hierarchy, the order in which features
are drawn to the map. Subtle variations of fill and stroke color and opacity establish the ground (in this case
the urban extent, city boundaries, and neighborhoods). More strongly contrasting stroke color(s) are used for the
transportation routes, which rise to figure on the map and are likely the first point of engagement with a user.
